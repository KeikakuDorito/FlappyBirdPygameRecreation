Greetings... Exalted Ones... (haha)
You need the Pygame Module of Python to run the game.
To run the game, please run "rungame.py"
The game uses modules, but is coded in 30 FPS so the gameplay won't be as fluid. I coded most of this in a week.
I coded the menu and the source code of the game. (rungame.py and FlappyBirdRound1.py) entirely myself.


The button on the left of the Menu (1) indicates 1 player, and is a simple remake of the original flappy bird.

The button on the right of the menu (2) indicates 2 player, where one person controls the mouse and the gap between the pipes is chosen
with the mouse's location every interval.
